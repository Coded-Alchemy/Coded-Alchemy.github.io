                                After 10 years of building cutting-edge Android applications and delivering exceptional
                                mobile experiences, I am charting a bold new course into the field of cybersecurity.
                                My decade of experience as a software engineer has equipped me with a strong foundation
                                of transferable skills that empower me to protect and secure digital ecosystems in this
                                new role.

                            <p className="text-white-500 mt-8">
                                The rise in cyber threats has revealed the critical need for experts who can safeguard
                                sensitive information and defend against attacks. While working in mobile development, I
                                frequently encountered the need for secure coding practices and proactive threat
                                mitigation. This exposure sparked my interest in cybersecurity, driving me to pursue
                                certifications, training, and real-world projects in the field.
